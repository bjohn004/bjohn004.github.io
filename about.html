                <h3>About Me</h3>
                Hello! I hope you're having a great day, and I appreciate you taking the time to take a quick look at my portfolio.
                A little bit about me... I graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in 2011 with a Bachelor Degree in Civil Engineerng.
                My first Civil Engineering position out of college was with VAA, LLC where I mainly worked on the design of a wide range of agricultral facitlites and loop tracks. 
                Kimley-Horn and Associates was my next employer staring in late 2014, and I become a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Minnesota in 2015. My time there focused primarily on design and project management for multi-family, industrial, and retails projects.
                My expertise included efficent design and client coordination, and I worked on more than a handful of projects in the City of Minneapolis, and dozens of more projects around Minnesota.
                <br>
                <br>
                Deciding to take my career in a different path, I took some time away from engineering, and have since been working at Oak Hill Montessori working as a Toddler Aide in the toddler classrooms. Working with kids is simply fun, and I get a lot of joy from making the kids laugh and have a fun time!
                My next journey consists of goal to pursue a career in Data Analytics and Data Science. I've always been drawn to statstics and data, so I decided to enroll in a 24 week Bootcamp Certificate program at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in their Data Analytics and Visualization program.
                I will be receiving the certificate here in December of 2022 and look forward to what comes next!
